Phantom Echoes
################

Phantom Echos is an interactive 2D musical adventure that's
unlike any other!  The player chooses any song to upload. The 
landscape of the game is generated by melody of the song, and
the speed at which the landscape goes by varies with the tempo
of the song.

This game is built using the Echonest API and the HTML5 canvas during Tufts Hack
2013. Check us out on the Echonest blog!
